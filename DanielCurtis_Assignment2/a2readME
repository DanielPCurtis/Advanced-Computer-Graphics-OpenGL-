a) I created a star(kind of)  The star is visible, but when it 
turns to the side only a triangle is visible when it should be 
another star(2 triangles). It should be 4 stars(2 stars one 
size 2 stars another size).  It is fairly messy, but it fulfills
the basic requirements.  

b) all texture items I took from the folder LunaTextures+NormalMaps 
that came with the book.  

Sphere model taken from Prog6_1
Pyramid model taken from Prog5_1
Shuttle Obj taken from Prog6_3

c) I don't know if it is considered different but I added a Reset button
You can re-center the sun on the screen with the 'x' key.

d)Screenshot included

e) Tested successfully on PONG in RVR 5029
